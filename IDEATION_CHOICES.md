## Ideation
### Identifiable Need?
Throughout the course of the semester user testing, we saw that the startegies employed by our users in relationships to decided on a movie or show to watch was not very consistent throughout participants. Some would utilize strategies such as checking out video previews, or just repeatedly doom scrolling and asking their partner. As a result, we saw that most participants were taking up to 20 minutes deciding on what to watch which is the problem we decided to tackle with our app.

### How app targets need
SwipeFlix streamlines the decision-making process into a fast, guided swipe flow that helps couples arrive at a shared choice in minutes. The swipe-based mechanics introduce a light, gamified experience that keeps the process fun and interactive. This i
s perfect for making date nights smoother and more engaging.

### Value offered to Audience
Swipeflix transforms movie/show selection from a tedious back-and-forth into a simple, playful, and collaborative activity. Real-time swiping, instant agreement, and the removal of app-hopping mean two people can quickly land on something to watch while still enjoying the experience itself.

### Further Opportunities for Growth
We plan to introduce A/B-tested ad previews just before matching to optimize engagement, offer a low-cost subscription tier that unlocks more than 10 swipes per session, and experiment with “session lives” to let users run additional sessions. We’re also exploring a seamless deep-link from the recommendations view directly into the streaming app, along with account-based personalization to deliver more relevant content and a stickier user experience.
